Generate a lecture scribe intended strictly as exam-oriented reference material for CSE400 – Fundamentals of Probability in Computing, Lecture 9. Use ONLY the provided Lecture 9 slides (PDF) as the authoritative context. Do not use any external sources, prior knowledge, or material not explicitly present in the slides. While writing the lecture scribe, reason step by step through all material exactly as presented in the lecture. This includes, where they appear in the slides: • Definitions and notation • Assumptions and conditions • Statements of results or properties • Proofs or derivations, written step by step • Worked examples and in-class problems, including all intermediate steps shown The reasoning and logical flow used in the lecture must be made explicit in the scribe so that a student can reconstruct the arguments during exam revision. All reasoning must come strictly from the provided slides. Include all content covered in Lecture 9, organized in the same order as the lecture, including (but only if present in the slides): • Continuous random variables • Uniform random variable (PDF, CDF, examples, applications) • Exponential random variable (PDF, CDF, conditions, examples) • Laplace and Gamma random variables, if and only if they appear in the slides • Any in-class problems or problem-solving steps shown Do NOT add new explanations, intuition, examples, interpretations, or material from other lectures. Do NOT omit any steps from derivations, proofs, or example solutions. Do NOT introduce content that is not explicitly present in the slides. Maintain a formal academic tone suitable for exam preparation. Organize the scribe following the lecture structure. Output the complete lecture scribe directly in LaTeX source format. give me letex code Finally, please ensure that each and every thing in the ppt , all concepts, all slides , all pages are covered.
