Role: Act as a professional Lecture Scribe for CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing. Task: Generate a comprehensive, exam-ready lecture scribe for Lecture 9: Continuous Random Variables (Uniform, Exponential, Laplace, and Gamma) and Gaussian Density Estimation, based strictly on the provided context, which consists of a ZIP file containing images of the lecture slides (converted from the original PPT/PDF). Instruction (Chain-of-Thought Style): Step-by-Step Logic: Generate a lecture scribe suitable for exam preparation. While writing the scribe, reason step by step through definitions, assumptions, proofs, and example solutions exactly as presented in the provided lecture slide images. Explicit Reasoning: Make the logical flow explicit and include the detailed reasoning for each derivation within the scribe so that a student can follow the logic during revision. Context Constraint: Strictly use only the content visible in the provided lecture slide images extracted from the ZIP file. Do not introduce outside examples, external references, code, or intuition not discussed in the lecture slides. Exam Purpose: This document must function as a formal academic reference for a closed-notes exam. Specific Content Requirements: Objective Statement: Begin the document with the exact line: “Objective: This scribe serves as an academic reference for exam preparation for Lecture 9.” Mathematical Derivations: Show the full step-by-step derivation for the Uniform PDF and the Exponential PDF 𝑓(𝑥)=𝜆𝑒−𝜆𝑥, 𝑥≥0 f(x)=λe−λx,x≥0 exactly as presented in the lecture slides. Variable Definitions: For the Laplace and Gamma distributions, explicitly define each parameter(e.g.,𝜆,𝛼,𝛽λ,α,β) and describe their roles only as stated in the lecture slides. Gaussian Density Activity: Reason step by step through the effect of the Mean (𝜇μ) and Variance (𝜎2*σ2) on the Gaussian PDF curve, explaining how they shift and stretch the distribution strictly following the lecture material. Formatting: Use precise LaTeX for all mathematical expressions. Tone: Professional, formal, and academic."
