Generate a lecture scribe intended to serve as exam-oriented reference material for Lecture 9. 
Use only the provided context (lecture slides and relevant textbook content). 
While writing the scribe, reason step by step through definitions, assumptions, proofs, derivations, and example solutions exactly as presented in the context.
 Make the reasoning explicit so the document can be used directly for revision. 
 Include: Definitions and notation Assumptions and conditions Theorem or result statements Step-by-step proofs or derivations when present 
 Worked examples with intermediate reasoning Logical structure reflecting the lecture flow Maintain a formal academic tone appropriate for exam study.
  Do not invent content, add intuition not discussed in lecture, or include material beyond the provided context.
   Ensure all reasoning is grounded strictly in the lecture and textbook material. 
   Finally, please ensure that each and every thing in the ppt , all concepts, all slides , all pages are covered.
