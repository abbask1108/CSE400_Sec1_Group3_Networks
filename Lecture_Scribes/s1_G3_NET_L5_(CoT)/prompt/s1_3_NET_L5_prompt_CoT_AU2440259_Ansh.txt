Generate a lecture scribe intended strictly as exam-oriented reference material for CSE400 – Fundamentals of Probability in Computing, Lecture 5. Use ONLY the provided context (Lecture 5 slides / PDF and relevant textbook content explicitly covered in this lecture). Do not introduce any new material, examples, interpretations, or intuition beyond what appears in the context. While writing the scribe, reason step by step through: • Definitions and notation • Assumptions and conditions • Statements of results • Proofs, derivations, and worked examples Make the logical flow explicit exactly as presented in the lecture so that a student can reconstruct reasoning during exam revision. The scribe must include, where present in the context: • Bayes’ Theorem as a weighted average of conditional probabilities • Learning-by-example problems and their step-by-step solutions • Law of Total Probability and Bayes Formula, including assumptions • Definitions and properties of random variables • Discrete random variables and distributions • Probability Mass Function (PMF) with properties • Worked PMF examples exactly as shown Maintain a formal academic tone suitable for a closed-notes exam. Do not invent content, do not simplify explanations, and do not add examples.
