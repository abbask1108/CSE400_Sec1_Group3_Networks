Generate a lecture scribe intended to serve as exam-reference material for CSE400 Lecture 5: Bayes’ Theorem, Random Variables, and Probability Mass Function. The scribe must faithfully reconstruct the lecture content so that a student can reliably revise the lecture using only this document. Use only the provided context (lecture slides/PDF and relevant textbook excerpts). Do not introduce any content, examples, explanations, interpretations, or intuition that are not present in the provided context. While writing the lecture scribe, reason step-by-step through all definitions, notation, assumptions, results, proofs, derivations, conceptual transitions, and worked examples exactly as presented in the provided context. Ensure that all logical dependencies between ideas are explicitly explained so that the reasoning can be followed during exam revision. The lecture scribe must clearly and systematically reconstruct the lecture structure, including: 1. Bayes’ Theorem - Step-by-step explanation of expressing events using set relationships - Derivation of probability as a weighted average of conditional probabilities - Formal development using the Law of Total Probability - Step-by-step derivation of Bayes’ Formula - Explanation of apriori and posteriori probabilities - Step-by-step reconstruction of all worked examples shown in the lecture 2. Random Variables - Motivation for defining random variables using experiment-based examples - Formal definition of a random variable as a function on the sample space - Explanation of discrete and continuous random variables as presented - Explanation of distribution of a random variable and interpretation using probability assignments - Step-by-step reconstruction of all examples involving random variables 3. Probability Mass Function (PMF) - Definition of discrete random variables - Formal definition of Probability Mass Function - Properties of PMF including probability summation requirements - Step-by-step reconstruction of PMF examples presented in the lecture Include: - Definitions and notation exactly as introduced - Assumptions and conditions associated with results - Theorem or result statements when presented - Step-by-step proofs or derivations when present - Step-by-step worked examples when present - Clear logical transitions between major topics Maintain a formal academic tone appropriate for exam preparation. Do not: - Add new examples or explanations - Simplify into tutorial-style teaching - Include material from outside the provided lecture or textbook content
