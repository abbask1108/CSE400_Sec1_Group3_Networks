Generate a lecture scribe intended to serve as exam-oriented reference material for Lecture 5.
 Use only the provided context (lecture slides and relevant textbook content). 
 While writing the scribe, reason step by step through all definitions, assumptions, theorems, proofs, derivations, and worked examples exactly as presented in the context. 
 Make the logical flow explicit so that a student can follow the reasoning during revision.
  Include: Definitions and notation 
  Assumptions and conditions 
  Statements of results and 
  theorems Step-by-step proofs or derivations when present 
  Worked examples with intermediate steps
   Clear logical connections between ideas 
   Maintain a formal academic tone suitable for exam preparation. 
   Do not introduce new explanations, examples, intuition, or material not present in the provided context. 
   Ensure all reasoning and content come strictly from the lecture and textbook.
