Generate a formal lecture scribe for CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing using only the provided Tutorial_1_Solution.pdf as context. This scribe must serve as exam-oriented reference material suitable for closed-notes preparation. While writing the scribe, reason step by step through every definition, assumption, formula, derivation, and probability computation exactly as presented in the context. All reasoning must be included inside the scribe itself. Requirements: • Follow a clear structure with sections Q1–Q10. • Maintain formal academic tone. • Include all intermediate algebraic and probability steps. • Explicitly state when complement rule, conditional probability, De Morgan’s law, Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, Gaussian distribution, Q-function, or summation arguments are used (only as shown in the context). • When identifying a distribution, first state how its parameters are determined from the problem. • When computing conditional probabilities, clearly show numerator and denominator before simplification. • Do not skip steps or compress derivations. Strict constraints: • Use only material present in the provided context. • Do not add intuition, alternative methods, or new examples. • Do not summarize or shorten computations. • Do not include meta-commentary. The final output should be detailed enough to span approximately 8–10 pages when converted to LaTeX. Output only the complete lecture scribe. give me the letex code based on this prompt Finally, please ensure that each and every thing in the ppt , all concepts, all slides , all pages are covered.
